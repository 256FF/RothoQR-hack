**Rotho** is a manufacturer of household organizing boxes. Every box has an QR-Code so that this box and it's content can be added to the APPmyBOX App.
The QR Code is a simple URL consiting of the article number (e.g. 4229) and a serial number.
With this info it's easy to create own QR-Codes to add and organize your own boxes to the Rotho APPmyBOX App.
